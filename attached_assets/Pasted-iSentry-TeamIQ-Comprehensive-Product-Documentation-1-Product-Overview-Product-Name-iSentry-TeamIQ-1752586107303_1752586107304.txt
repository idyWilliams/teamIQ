iSentry TeamIQ: Comprehensive Product Documentation
1. Product Overview
Product Name: iSentry TeamIQ
Tagline: AI-Powered Intern & Team Intelligence Platform
Elevator Pitch:
iSentry TeamIQ is a unified, AI-driven dashboard that transforms how engineering teams and HR manage interns, projects, and talent growth. It seamlessly merges real-time skill analytics, dynamic task allocation, sentiment monitoring, and automated retrospectives, providing actionable insights for technical and HR leaders.

2. Strategic Rationale
Business Goals:
Remove guesswork from intern/project fit and support.
Provide objective, data-driven career and performance metrics.
Enable bias-free hiring, promotion, and retention decisions.
Enable Project Monitoring feature
Position iSentry as the leader in secure, intelligent talent analytics.
Target Market:
Tech recruiters, HR teams, engineering managers, coding bootcamps, and EdTech providers.

3. Core Features & AI Integration
A. Real-Time Skill Analytics Dashboard
Integrates with GitHub/Jira to track code diffs, ticket history, and more.
Generates skill graphs (e.g., "React proficiency ↑ 25%"), productivity trends, and growth metrics.
Commercial Hook: Sell as an advanced LMS to bootcamps.
B. Dynamic Task Allocation Engine
AI matches interns to optimal projects based on skills, team needs, and growth opportunities.
Suggests team reassignments for mentorship or skill development.
Commercial Hook: License as a task engine to remote-work tools.
C. Sentiment & Blockers Radar
NLP engine monitors Slack/Discord for signals of blockers, stress, or mentorship needs.
Flags at-risk interns and suggests timely interventions.
Commercial Hook: HR teams value mental health and productivity analytics.
D. Auto-Generated Retrospectives
AI summarizes sprint outcomes, highlights improvements, and identifies skill gaps.
Commercial Hook: Saves Agile teams time and ensures objective retrospectives.

4. Technical Architecture
A. Data Ingestion Layer
Sources:
GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket: Commits, PR reviews, code quality.
Jira/Asana/Trello: Ticket completion, complexity, collaboration.
Slack/Discord/Teams: Sentiment, blockers, mentorship requests.
CI/CD (Jenkins, GitHub Actions): Build/deployment metrics.
B. AI Processing Layer
Skill Graph Engine:
Aggregates raw data into skill scores using Python and scikit-learn.
Example: Frequent, high-quality Python PRs increase Python skill score.
NLP for Soft Skills:
Fine-tuned Llama 3/Mistral models analyze communication for leadership, blockers, and collaboration.
Task Matching Model:
Uses k-nearest neighbors (KNN) to match engineers to projects/tasks based on skill gaps.
C. Dashboard Layer
Engineer Profile:
Timeline of roles, skill radar charts, and growth trends.
HR/Recruiter View:
Retention and promotion alerts, bias-free candidate profiles.

5. Example Code Snippets
Skill-gap Based Task Assignment
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors

intern_skills = [[5, 3, 1], ...]   # Python, React, AWS levels
project_needs = [[3, 8, 2], ...]   # Project skill requirements

model = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=1).fit(project_needs)
best_project_indices = model.kneighbors(intern_skills)[^1]  # Finds best project match


Skill Scoring Algorithm
def calculate_python_score(developer_commits):
    total_python_commits = sum(1 for commit in developer_commits if "py" in commit.files)
    peer_reviews = get_peer_reviews(developer_id)  # PR approval rate
    code_quality = get_sonarqube_score(developer_id)  # Bug-free %
    return (total_python_commits * 0.4) + (peer_reviews * 0.3) + (code_quality * 0.3)
